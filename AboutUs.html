			  <h3 style="color:#22ff00">What we are and what we do</h3>
			  <p style="color:#22ff00">We are a team of developers that consist of 3 Coders, 5 Helpers. This site is used around 5 schools aroung the globe. One in spain, mexico, texas, New York, Pennsylvania. We managed to spread this site by our friend's that we know. Without them, this site would only be known in 1 school. We are hoping on removing school blockers and give proxy's and bypass games in order to play them. We don't have enough games because of one reason...popularity. We only add games that are popular, so adding games is pretty hard considering the owners won't let you add their game. We only have popular games at the moment but were planning in adding more in the future..popular and unpopular.<br> Thanks For Reading <br> Date: 12/28/2023 Time: 3:25 AM</p>
